This plugin herps all the derps.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0 =
* Created

= 1.1 =
* Apparently if a plugin hasn't been updated in over 2 years, WordPress.org removes it from the public plugin directory under the assumption that it is no longer maintained. That's my punishment for getting it right the first time, I guess.

  So, I herped the version number. Derp.

= 1.2 =
* Derp.

= 1.3 =
* Don't keep herping after un-derping. Herp.

= 1.4 =
* Derpier herps.

= 1.5 =
* Made the JS be asyncable. Eliminated some PHP warnings.

= 1.6 =
* Moved the "Herp by default" checkbox to the "Settings / Discussion" page.

= 1.7 =
* Omit unnecessary derpery on feed pages.
